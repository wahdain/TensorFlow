Linear Regression Implementation with TensorFlow

### Overview
This project demonstrates a complete implementation of linear regression using TensorFlow, featuring:
- Gradient descent optimization with automatic differentiation
- Training progress visualization
- Model evaluation metrics
- Interactive plotting during training

### Key Features
#### 1- Core Algorithm
  - Implements y = w*x + b linear regression
  - Uses Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
  - Adam optimizer for efficient training
#### 2- Visualizations
  - Live-updating training plots
  - Loss curve tracking
  - Final fit visualization
  - Prediction vs ground truth comparison
#### 3- Training Features
  - Early stopping when loss stabilizes
  - Progress printing every 500 iterations
  - Parameter initialization with small random values
